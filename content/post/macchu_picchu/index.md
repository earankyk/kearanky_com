I did the 4d/3n Inca trail during Nov 2019, and was in total awe of my experience. This series of blog posts summarizes my experiences during the trip.

### How the trip happened?
As I was turning 25, I wanted to gift myself something exciting - Like a vacation in a country I hadn't visited before!
I've a preference for traveling alone, mostly because I feel it's too much effort to convince other friends to join me
and coordinate the planning with them. So, I looked up tour operators who worked with solo travellers and found GAdventures.

I browsed through their offerings and my eyes landed on the Inca Trail. I love hiking and losing myself in the quiet of 
nature. And I had never done such an intensive hike involving camping in the mountains before. The hike being laden with history was just the icing on the cake.

The Inca trail is regulated by the Peruvian government, they only allow 500 people on the trail per day. So, people book
their trips 4-5 months in advance. The peak season for doing the trail is May - Sept, however I couldn't find a date during that season. I ended up booking my trip towards the end of October (the onset of the rainy season :/), however my heart was set on doing the hike so I didn't really care!

I finally ended up booking the [Inca Discovery trip](https://www.gadventures.com/trips/inca-discovery/PID/) from Oct 26 - Nov 4.

### Preparation for the hike
As part of my research I read people's experiences on the hike. The common themes I found in them were:  

1. It's a hard hike - *a knee killer*.  
2. The views are beautiful.  
3. There's a lot of Incan history to be seen on the trail.  
4. Altitude sickness can be a real issue.  
5. The weather can change rapidly between cold, hot and rainy during the day. 
6. Good hiking gear is highly recommended.

I decided to prepare myself for the hike by working out on the stair master. I started off with 100 floors in 30 min and
got upto 130 floors in 30 min by the time I was leaving for my trip. The prep for the hike kept me motivated me to hit the gym. And I developed a habit out of it, so thank you Inca trail!

I didn't really know whether I would suffer from altitude sickness because I've never spent much time in high altitudes. Thankfully I got a chance to visit Denver, Colorado a few weeks before the trip. I decided to do the [Royal Arch](https://dayhikesneardenver.com/royal-arch-trail-hike-in-boulder-colorado/) trail while I was there. I got a sense of hiking at an altitude - it's important to pace yourself initially, and drink tons of water.

We didn't study much about the Incan culture in Indian schools, so I decided to use this opportunity to learn more about them. I read Mark Adams' [Turn right at Macchu Picchu](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XFYIDS/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). It was light, enjoyable reading the experiences of an urbane New Yorker hiking the Andes.

I read through several packing guides for the Inca trail and bought most of my hiking gear at REI. Some of the key purchases I made were:  

1. Merrell Men's Moab 2 Vent Mid Hiking Boot.  
2. Osprey Stratos 24L Day Pack and 3L hydration pack (highly recommend getting the hydration pack).  
3. Medium weight Fleece Jacket.  
4. Celestron Outlander Binoculars.  
5. Merino wool hiking socks (highly recommend).
