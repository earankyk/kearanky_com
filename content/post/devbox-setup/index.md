My laptop, a 2014 macbook pro is my regular go to for my development work.  
However, when I tried to build the [Kata containers project](https://katacontainers.io/) project, my mac would make that all too familiar whirring sound noisily informing me of it's pain :(  
That is when I decided I should probably setup a vpc and start working on there, and use my laptop as a [dumb terminal](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/dumb_terminal.html).  
Being a regular listener of the [cloudcast podcast](https://www.thecloudcast.net/) (which I also highly recommend for any cloud nerd), I've been itching to give the Digital Ocean VPCs a spin for a while!  
Luckily the listeners of the show get a 50$ credit to use on DO!
