*Mexican Gothic* by Silvia Moreno-Garcia is a horror mystery set in the Mexico of the 1950s. Noemí, our heroine, visits her newly married cousin in her husband's ancestral home. Noemí's actually there to investigate the haunted Doyle house (at least her cousin thinks it's haunted). Noemí's investigation is a wild ride into colonialism, eugenics, incest and mold (lots and lots of mold!).

Readers of the book complained that *Mexican Gothic* is slow in the first half. I felt that was a feature, not a bug. The author slow *cooks*  the eerie, reclusive backdrop of the once successful mining town like a stew. In contrast, both Mexico city and it's native Noemí, are like a taco - fast, vibrant, social.

Silvia writes many deliberate scenes showing the atmosphere (literally) around the Doyle house. The scene in the cemetery when Noemí gets lost in the mist, and hears a continuous buzzing sound comes to mind. This is not superfluous though. It sets up the reader's imagination of the Doyle house for the rest of the book. And it also foreshadows the revelation at the ending, in hindsight.

Noemí's psychedelic nightmares in the Doyle house were a delight to read. Some of (most of?) them are orthogonal to the plot. But, I read a book for more than the story. The nightmares are key for the reader to feel the *vibe* of the house. They're also a fun window into Noemí's mind - her unconscious desire toward Virgil Doyle for example. I wish the author used this trope to explore Noemí further. I liked Noemí.

That said, there were some plot holes. For example, we learn at the end that a fungus lies at the heart of the hauntings in the house. Noemí is an anthropology student but she doesn't use her knowledge in any meaningful way during her *investigation*. SMH.

I agree with the other common opinion that the ending feels rushed. Howard Doyle's interaction with the monks to get the fungus (How did Doyle find these monks?). Whatever Agnes did to keep the fungus in the family (I'm not sure what happened there tbh). The climax felt like Sylvia was running over time in her presentation, and the teacher asked her to wrap up.

The repeated references to [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) led me to believe the symbol would play an important role in the ending. It was not insignificant, but it was a tad bit disappointing. I was thinking it might be the symbol for a cult or a secret society perhaps? But no, it 's just good ole Howard Doyle consuming his babies (Figuratively, and literally). Felt like a missed opportunity to create a grander ending to me.

The story is not new ([Get Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out) comes to mind, for example). But Sylvia makes it up by taking me to a time (~1870-1950), and place (rural Mexico) that I've not experienced before. And for that reason Mexican Gothic felt fresh to me.

Noemí's character allows the old wine to breathe, a little, in this new bottle. I can totally see [Ana de Armas](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1869101/) playing her in the mini-series/movie adaptation!

Summing up, *Mexican Gothic* is a page turner. I'd recommend checking it out, it's spooktober after all!
