I set 21 goals for myself in 2020. In this post, I'm going to go over each of them and do a review asking myself 3 questions (where relevant):

* Did I complete the goal?
* What worked?
* What didn't work?

I also met a few goals that I hadn't planned for too, I cover them in the unplanned goals section.

## Planned goals
---
1. **Write 1 blog post every month**
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      Yes.
    * What worked?  
      * Writing a blog post became a gateway to find new topics of interest. I wrote about [investing](https://kearanky.com/post/to_401k_or_not_to_401k/), [travel](https://kearanky.com/post/macchu_picchu_1/), [quantum computing](https://kearanky.com/post/quantum_speedup/), among others. Writing helped clarify my thoughts.
    * What didn't work?
      * Finding a right topic and getting into a flow state was painful. I need to find a dedicated time for writing every day/week.  
  
2. **Try homebrewing**
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      * Nope, second year in a row.
    * What worked?
      * Nothing, just didn't feel like it.
    * What didn't work?
      * Other hobbies occupied my time.  
  
3. **Learn technical and fundamental analysis** 
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      * Partially. I did a few related things:
            * Read [*A random walk down wall street*](https://www.amazon.com/Random-Walk-Down-Wall-Street/dp/0393330338).
            * Watched a few [Ashwath Damodaran](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLvnJL8htRR1T9cbSccaoVw) videos.
            * Tried to read [*technical analysis for dummies*](https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Analysis-Dummies-Barbara-Rockefeller/dp/0470888008) (and hated it). 
            * Did a few [CBOE options courses](https://www.cboe.com/education) (although, I don't anymore about options now than I did earlier).
    * What worked?
      * *A random walk down wall street* helped me build my current investment portfolio.
    * What didn't work?
      * Simply reading books/watching videos doesn't get you far when it comes to understanding fundamental analysis. Have to get my hands dirty i.e. actually use fundamental analysis on companies in my portfolio.  
  
4. **Reach out to one old friend every month** 
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      * Partially. I reached out to old friends till July (7/12).
    * What worked?
      * This is a great way to re-connect with close-ish friends, who you'd get in touch with eventually at some point - through common whatsapp groups etc.
    * What didn't work?
      * I kinda ran out of such close-ish friends by July.   
  
5. **Go on 5 hikes** 
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      * Yes. What else would I do in Corona.
    * What worked?
      * I naturally go on hikes, I probably don't need a goal for this. 
    * What didn't work?
      * Not much. One way to make this more challenging would be to make them overnight hikes.  
  
6. **Do 3 online courses** 
    * Did I complete the goal?  
      * Yes.
    * What worked?
      * This is another excellent tool for discovering new interests. I really liked the [Mountains 101](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mountains-101) course. 
    * What didn't work?
      * I couldn't complete [ModPo](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modpo) because of time crunch. I do intend to take it again next year.  
  
7. **Watch 1 documentary a month** 
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Probably not. Twice in a row.
    * What worked?
      * Nothing really.
    * What didn't work?
      * I tend to watch tv for relaxation, books for knowledge. Documentaries don't fit in, unless they're relaxing.  
  
8. **Go to 1 meetup every month**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No. CORONA!
    * What worked?
      * I enjoyed the JC Word bookclub meetup while it lasted.
    * What didn't work?
      * The human immune system.  
  
9. **Donate 250$ to NPR, NYPL, Nirmaan etc.**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Yes.  
  
10. **Do 1 DIY raspberry pi project**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No.
    * What worked?
      * Nothing.
    * What didn't work?
      * Other hobbies took up my time.  
  
11. **Driver's license**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * YES. FINALLY!  
  
12. **Try kickboxing**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No.
    * What worked?
      * Nothing.
    * What didn't work?
      * Other hobbies took up my time.  
  
13. **Try word bookclub in JC**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Yes.
    * What worked?
      * Yet another excellent discovery mechanism. I tried the [garbage water thursdays bookclub](https://www.wordbookstores.com/garbage-water-thursdays) in Word, Jersey City until Corona struck. I would've never picked up the selections in this book club otherwise.
    * What didn't work?
      * Covid. I moved on to the virtual [MMD bookclub](https://members.modernmrsdarcy.com/). Although, I've noticed it's much easier for me to have a physical discussion than a virtual one when it comes to bookclubs.  
  
14. **Watch all major sporting finals**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No. Second year in a row.
    * What worked?
      * Nothing. I barely watched any sports at all this year.
    * What didn't work?
      * There were few sporting events this year due to Covid. And even then I didn't find them interesting enough.  
  
15. **Brush my teeth at night every day**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Mostly yes.
    * What worked?
      * Made it a part of my bedtime ritual. 
    * What didn't work?
      * Skipped it when I was too tired at bedtime.  
  
16. **Visit 1 new National Park** 
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No. 
    * What worked?
      * Nothing. 
    * What didn't work?
      * Novel corona virus.  
  
17. **Make one Instagram post a month** 
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No. 
    * What worked?
      * Nothing. 
    * What didn't work?
      * This was my attempt to be more social online. Turns out I only like to post stuff online when it means something. Posting at a cadence is not my thing.  
  
18. **Write 200 words a day**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Mostly, no. 
    * What worked?
      * My method of implementing this was writing Dear Diary entries. I realized that whenever I did write these entries, they helped me introspect my day, and understand my feelings. It feels good to build a story of your day. 
    * What didn't work?
      * On most days I was too tired to write. 200 words seemed like a hurdle to undertake. I'm going to change this goal to **Write for 15 minutes every day** instead for 2021.  
  
19. **Holiday in a new country**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * No. 
    * What worked?
      * Nothing. 
    * What didn't work?
      * Bats.  
  
20. **Read 12 books**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Yes. 
    * What worked?
      * Thanks to the lockdown, I was able to read 24 books this year.  
    * What didn't work?
      * Not much. But I'd like to improve my reading speed for 2021.  
  
21. **Continue with improv/story-telling/sketch writing**
    * Did I complete the goal?
      * Yes. 
    * What worked?
      * I took Adam Wade's story-telling class, and did a story-telling show. It was loads of fun! 
    * What didn't work?
      * Magnet moved to online classes due to covid. Will take more classes if they open back physically in 2021.  

## Unplanned goals
---

22. **Ran a half marathon**
    * What worked?
      * I began running in March since that was the only option for exercise. I'm glad I stuck with it! 
      * I followed Hal Higdon's [Novice-2](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/) half marathon plan, and intend to run a marathon next year.  
  
23. **Began playing the ukulele**
    * What worked?
      * Yet another quarantine hobby. I did a few [covers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvwuFtQAtQ-vEx2kctHdpO3wRml9JC1c7) and I'm looking forward to learning to read tabs.

## Summary
---
I achieved 11 out of my 23 goals this year, a 47% hit rate. It's still an improvement over my 42% hit rate for 2019.

Here's to a happy 2021! :beers:
